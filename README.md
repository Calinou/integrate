# Integrate

**Integrate self-installed software into a FreeDesktop system.**

This script creates a desktop entry and a launcher script placed into the `PATH`
for any of your self-installed applications. This is mainly useful for software
not coming from package repositories.

## Installation

### Using a pre-compiled script

*TODO*

### From source

1. Install [Argbash](https://argbash.io/) somewhere in your `PATH`.
2. Clone this repository or [download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/Calinou/integrate/archive/master.zip).
3. Change into the repository's root directory then type `make && sudo make install`.
4. Enjoy!

## Usage

```
integrate path/to/program
```

The program will ask you a few questions, such as the application name and an
optional comment. The path to the application binary or script can be absolute
or relative, it bears no importance on the final result.
